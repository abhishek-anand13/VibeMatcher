Reflection - Vibe Matcher

Vibe is a very subjective topic, it varies from person to person but by doing this project it taught me how powerful embeddings
can be when you want a machine to understand something such as vibe.

EDGE CASES I THOUGHT ABOUT 

Q. What if the model doesn’t find a confident match?  
  → I added a fallback message for low scores so the system always responds gracefully.
Q. What if queries use totally new words?  
  → The embeddings still pick up similar semantic directions, which was really interesting to see.

- I also tested multiple “vibe types” to make sure it wasn’t just matching the same items every time.

Improvements & Next Steps  
1. Integrate a vector database (Pinecone / FAISS) for faster, scalable search.  
2. Expand dataset with hundreds of real fashion descriptions to improve representation and similarity accuracy.  
3. Fine-tune embeddings on domain-specific data (fashion blogs, trend reports) to enhance nuance.  
4. Add a frontend (Streamlit or Gradio) to make it interactive and user-facing.  
5. Explore hybrid ranking and combine semantic similarity with metadata (price, fabric, weather).
